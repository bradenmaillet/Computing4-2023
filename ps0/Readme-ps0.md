## Contact
Name: Braden Maillet

Section: Comp 2040 204

Time to Complete: 1-2 hours(mostly research and trouble shooting)


## Description
Explain what the project is supposed to do

	This project is a simple sprite in the sfml client that can move around
	with keys W, A, S, D and rotate by with the left mouse button.
	
### Features
Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way.

	 There weren't any major decisions in this project it was mostly researching and familiarizing myself with the sfml library.
	 
### Issues
What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.

     Most things work as intended. I did notice that the rotate feature was a little finnicky.
     I beleive this is due to the size of the image uploaded
     
### Extra Feature
Describe anything special you did.  This is required to earn points.

     The "special" feature was the rotate feature using the left mouse key stroke.

## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

There are six examples of academic misconduct, labeled (a) through (f). Other than (a), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.

      In my opinion I think B most applys to this class. To take work form others or falsify the product of your own(or others) work is not only
      a disservice to the university but yourself aswell. We are all paying to be here to learn how to be successful in our own career paths. The
      only way this can be acheived is through practice. So if a student were to make such a violation they would be missing out on a valuable
      opportunity to learn something that will undoubtedly be useful in a future professional endeavor.
